# Competitive programming
This repo has solutions to problems I solve during regular CP / DSA practice.

I mainly use it to:
- keep track of what I’ve solved
- revise old problems
- save implementations that I might reuse later

## Platforms
- CSES
- Codeforces
- CodeChef
- AtCoder (sometimes)

## Language
- C++ (mostly)

## What you’ll find here
- math and implementation problems
- greedy and binary search
- basic graphs and DP (learning phase)

Not meant to be a polished project repo, just practice code.
